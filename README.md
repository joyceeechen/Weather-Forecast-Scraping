# Weather-Forecast-Scraping
DATA DESIGN &amp; REPRESENTATION Final Project

This report details how we constructed a 7-day weather forecast NoSQL database for cities in California through web scraping and API calls. We believe that weather forecasting empowers businesses to make decisions ahead, optimize resource allocation and avert potential risks. We decided to store the data into MongoDB to cater to the dynamic nature of weather forecasting data with the agility of updating MongoDB documents.
